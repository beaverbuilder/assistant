Assistant is a free plugin that allows you to work more efficiently in WordPress. It’s a huge time saver and fun to use!
Assistant is a stand-alone tool that provides shortcuts to common tasks, and will help you work more freely without needing to go to the WordPress admin as much.

= Features =

*   Access the front-end UI from anywhere (posts, pages, archives, etc...)

Assistant Pro is not just an awesome cloud storage platform, perfect for organizing and finding your favorite WordPress assets, it’s a better way of working across all your WordPress sites.
