# Assistant - Work In Progress

![Master Branch Status](https://travis-ci.org/beaverbuilder/assistant.svg?branch=master)

A tool for seeing what's happening inside WordPress and quickly navigating between pages & posts.

## Installation
After cloning the repo you will need to build the js and css bundles before the plugin will display. You can do that by:

```
cd /to/your/repo/folder
npm install
npm run build
```
If that looks foreign, ask Brent or Justin about it.

Testing

Test again
